Maje
====

Maje is a simple utility to generate basic Makefiles for simple utilities. Maje
scans a directory tree for C source code, and builds a Makefile with proper
dependency information based on that code. The Makefile in this source tree
is itself generated by Maje.

There are a few restrictions:

- Source files must be named ending with .c.

- Only executables are supported, not libraries (there must be a main()).

- Only one executable per source tree is supported (exactly one main()).

- Maje expects the resulting binary to have the same base name as the source
file containing main() (e.g. if main() is in maje.c, the binary will be called
maje).

Maje has no command line options, and supports only a single (optional)
operand. If given, the operand is the path to a directory containing source
for an out-of-source-tree build. If not specified, Maje defaults to using
the current directory (.).
